# Tesla Order Status Tracker (TOST) 🚗📦
Stay in control of your Tesla order from the moment you place it until delivery. This open-source Python CLI tool gives you direct access to the Tesla API so you always know what is happening with your vehicle.
> 🖥️ Prefer a GUI? check my TOST app: https://www.tesla-order-status-tracker.de

# This repository contains the CLI script only. The GUI linked above is a separate project.

## Why You'll Love It
- 🔍 **Direct Tesla API connection**: Get the latest order information without any detours.
- 🧾 **Display of important details**: Vehicle options, production and delivery progress.
- 🕒 **History at a glance**: Every change (e.g. VIN allocation) is documented locally.
- 📋 **Share mode output**: Anonymized output for forums and social media, with optional clipboard copy in `--share` mode.
- 🔁 **Multi-order ready**: Handles multiple Tesla orders at once, with `--order <reference>` to focus on a single one.
- 🧩 **Modular & expandable**: Option codes, languages and features can be flexibly expanded.
- 🔐 **Privacy-focused**: Tokens and settings remain on your device and telemetry is disabled.

The goal is to give users more transparency and control over the ordering process – without depending on external services.

## Get Started
Download the complete project to your machine. If you are unsure how, you can grab the ZIP archive directly from GitHub: https://github.com/enoch85/tesla-order-status/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
> ⚠️ Do not run single scripts without the rest of the repository. Everything is meant to work together.

## Installation
1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your operating system.
2. Tested environment: Ubuntu 24.04 with `python3`.
3. In the tested Ubuntu 24.04 environment, no additional Python packages were required.
4. If your local Python environment does not already provide the optional modules used by the script, install them manually:
```sh
python3 -m pip install requests pyperclip colorama
```
- `requests`: fallback install if your Python environment does not already provide it
- `pyperclip`: optional clipboard copy in `--share` mode
- `colorama`: optional ANSI color support on Windows terminals

### Runtime Notes
- This project is distributed as a Python script, not as a packaged Windows or Linux binary.
- Ubuntu 24.04 is the primary tested environment.
- The code includes Windows-specific locale and terminal color handling, so Windows may work as well, but it should be treated as best-effort unless you verify it in your environment.

### Optional Virtual Environment
For a clean setup, create a virtual environment before installing any optional packages:
```sh
# create the environment
python3 -m venv .venv
# activate it
source .venv/bin/activate
# install optional packages just for this project
python3 -m pip install requests pyperclip colorama
```

## Usage
Run the main script to fetch and display your order details:
```sh
python3 tesla_order_status.py
```
### Optional flags:
Get an overview of all command-line options:
```sh
python3 tesla_order_status.py --help
```
#### Output Modes
Only one of the options can be used at a time.
- `--all` display every available key in your history (verbose output)
- `--details` show additional information such as financing details.
- `--share` hide personal data like order ID and VIN for sharing. limits output to dates and status changes.
- `--status` only report whether the order information has changed since the last run. no login happens, so tesla_tokens.json have to be present already. token will get refreshed if necessary.
  - 0 => no changes
  - 1 => changes detected
  - 2 => pending updates
  - -1 => error ... you better run the script once without any params to make sure, it is working. Possibly the api token is invalid or there is no tesla_orders.json already
    
> 💡 When `pyperclip` is installed, a share-friendly summary is copied to your clipboard only in `--share` mode.

#### Work Modes
Work modes can be combined with any output mode:
- `--cached` – reuse locally cached order data without calling the API (perfect with `--share`)
- Automatic caching activates when you run the script again within one minute of a successful API request, keeping Tesla happy with fewer calls.

#### Order Filters
- `--order <referenceNumber>` – refresh every order in the background but only print the selected one (e.g. `--order RN123456`).

## Configuration
### General Settings
The script stores the configuration in `data/private/settings.json`. Feel free to tweak it—if something breaks, the script falls back to default values.

On the first run the script detects your system language and stores it as `language` in the settings file. Edit this entry to override the language manually. If no translation is available yet, the setting is simply ignored until one becomes available.

### Updates
The built-in updater only checks whether a newer version exists. Installing updates is now a manual step: download a verified release from GitHub and replace your local copy. The `hotfix.py` helper only applies a locally downloaded ZIP archive and no longer fetches code from the network.

### Option Codes
Known Tesla option codes are bundled locally in `data/public/option-codes/`,
including the complete offline catalog shipped with this repository. Option decoding
no longer depends on third-party lookups. You can still drop custom JSON files into
`data/public/option-codes` to override or extend the bundled data; local entries win
if multiple files define the same option code.

## History & Preview
The script stores the latest order information in `tesla_orders.json` and keeps a change log in `tesla_order_history.json`. Every detected difference—like a VIN assignment—is appended to the history file and displayed after the current status. The "Order Information" section always shows live data first, followed by historical changes.

## Telemetry
Telemetry is disabled in this repository configuration.

No anonymous usage statistics, option codes, banners, or other third-party telemetry
data are sent anywhere.

### Network policy

- Tesla API traffic is allowed because the tool needs it to authenticate and load order data.
- GitHub release metadata checks are allowed for update notifications.
- Third-party telemetry, remote banner fetches, and remote option-code lookups are disabled.
- Installing updates is always a manual action using a locally downloaded archive.

## Issues
If you have any issues, running the script or getting error messages, pleas feel free to ask for help in the [issues](https://github.com/enoch85/tesla-order-status/issues) section or pm me at the [tff-forum](https://tff-forum.de/u/chrisi51/summary)


## Disclaimer
- The script runs locally on your machine.
- No third-party data sharing is performed. Outbound traffic is limited to Tesla API calls and optional GitHub release metadata checks.
- You need to log in via browser and return the resulting URL to the script to extract the login token used for the API.
- The script only uses the token to work with for the current session.
- With your permission the script stores the token on your hard disk.
